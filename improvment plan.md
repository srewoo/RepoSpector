**Currently using: Claude Sonnet 4**

I'll analyze the complete workspace to understand the Chrome extension's architecture and identify issues. Let me start by exploring the project structure and examining the key files.

```

Based on my comprehensive analysis of the AI RepoSpector Chrome Extension codebase, I've identified several critical issues that prevent it from meeting the stated requirements. Here's my detailed analysis and plan:

## üîç CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. **Inconsistent File Structure & Build System**
- **Problem**: Files exist in both root and `src/` directories with duplicated functionality
- **Impact**: Manifest references both root files and src files, causing confusion and potential runtime errors
- **Examples**: 
  - `content.js` (root) vs `src/content/content.js`
  - `popup.js` (root) vs `src/popup/popup.js`
  - Root files use legacy approach, src files use ES6 modules

### 2. **Missing Core Feature: Diff Page Support**
- **Problem**: No specialized handling for diff/PR pages on GitHub, GitLab, etc.
- **Impact**: Won't work on diff pages as specified in requirements
- **Gap**: Need diff parsing logic to extract changed code blocks

### 3. **Incomplete Parallel Processing Integration**
- **Problem**: `batchProcessor.js` and `chunking.js` exist but aren't integrated into main workflow
- **Impact**: Large codebases won't be processed in parallel chunks as required
- **Gap**: Missing orchestration between chunking, batching, and LLM calls

### 4. **Insufficient Repository Context Analysis**
- **Problem**: Context analyzer has basic GitHub integration but misses critical features
- **Impact**: Won't provide "complete repo context" as required
- **Gaps**: 
  - No repository structure analysis
  - No dependency graph building
  - No test pattern detection
  - Limited file fetching (only 5 files max)

### 5. **Architecture & Integration Issues**
- **Problem**: Utilities in `src/utils/` aren't properly imported/used in main scripts
- **Impact**: Advanced features like encryption, sanitization, and context analysis aren't functional
- **Root Cause**: Mixed module system (ES6 vs script tags)

### 6. **Limited Platform Support**
- **Problem**: Focused mainly on GitHub with basic GitLab support
- **Impact**: Won't work optimally on other SCM platforms
- **Gap**: Need BitBucket, Azure DevOps, and other platform support

## üìã COMPREHENSIVE FIX PLAN

### Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture (High Priority)

#### 1.1 **Standardize File Structure**
- **Action**: Consolidate all source files into `src/` directory
- **Steps**:
  - Move root files (`popup.js`, `content.js`, `background.js`) to `src/`
  - Update manifest.json to reference correct paths
  - Implement proper ES6 module system throughout
  - Create unified build system using `dist/` for production files

#### 1.2 **Fix Module System**
- **Action**: Convert all files to ES6 modules with proper imports/exports
- **Steps**:
  - Update background.js to import utilities from `src/utils/`
  - Update popup.js to import utilities properly
  - Update content script to use shared utilities
  - Fix circular dependencies and import order

#### 1.3 **Integrate Existing Utilities**
- **Action**: Wire up all the utility modules into main workflow
- **Steps**:
  - Integrate `batchProcessor.js` into background script
  - Wire up `chunking.js` for large codebase handling
  - Connect `contextAnalyzer.js` to content script
  - Implement proper error handling with `errorHandler.js`

### Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation (Critical)

#### 2.1 **Diff Page Support**
- **Action**: Implement specialized diff page parsing

  - Build system detection

#### 2.3 **Parallel Processing Pipeline**
- **Action**: Implement end-to-end parallel processing
- **Components**:
  - Code chunking based on semantic boundaries
  - Parallel batch processing for multiple LLM calls
